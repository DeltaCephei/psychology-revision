# Claude Forge

Personal project workspace for Eliot Attridge — writer, teacher, and owner of Pursue Learning Ltd (innovative learning).

## Projects

- `psychology-revision/` — NCEA Psychology revision web app (static HTML/JS/CSS)

## How I Work

- **Role:** I'm a tinkerer, not a full-time developer. I build tools for teaching, learning, and creative projects.
- **Coding level:** Get it done with minimal explanation. Don't walk me through things unless I ask.
- **Comments in code:** Always add clear comments so I can learn from the code later.
- **Tone:** Professional, clear, concise. No waffle.
- **Keep it simple:** Favour straightforward, readable solutions. Don't over-engineer.

## Conventions

- **Language:** NZ English (colour, behaviour, organise, analyse, programme, etc.)
- **Tech:** Projects can use any technology — not limited to static sites.
- **Web design:** Handle accessibility and mobile-responsiveness on a case-by-case basis per project.
- **Version control:** Single git repo for the whole forge. Each project lives in its own subfolder with its own CLAUDE.md.

## Tools

- **NotebookLM MCP:** Connected (deornorth@gmail.com). Use proactively when NotebookLM content is relevant to what we're building — don't wait to be asked.
- **uv:** Python package manager at `~/.local/bin/uv`.
- **Re-auth if needed:** Quit Chrome, then run `~/.local/bin/nlm login`.

## Project Structure

Each project gets its own subdirectory with a project-specific `CLAUDE.md`. This root file covers shared preferences and conventions. Keep project-specific details in the project's own CLAUDE.md to avoid context bloat.
