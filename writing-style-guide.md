# Eliot Attridge — Writing Style Guide

Compiled from Pursue Learning (pursuelearning.net), N4L guest posts, LinkedIn, and Bluesky.

## Voice & Tone

- **Confident and direct.** States positions clearly without hedging. Doesn't overqualify or apologise for opinions.
- **Conversational but authoritative.** Reads like a knowledgeable colleague talking, not an academic paper. Accessible without being dumbed down.
- **Practical and grounded.** Always connects ideas back to real classroom experience. Theory serves practice, never the other way around.
- **Enthusiastic without being breathless.** Genuine excitement about tools and ideas comes through, but stays measured. No hype.
- **Self-describes as a "story-teller"** — uses narrative to carry ideas, not just exposition.

## Sentence Structure

- **Varied length.** Mixes short, punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. Short sentences for impact; longer ones for nuance.
- **Active voice preferred.** "I tested ChatGPT..." not "ChatGPT was tested..."
- **First person throughout.** Writes as "I" — shares personal experience and classroom experiments directly.
- **Clean and uncluttered.** No waffle (his own word). Sentences do a job and move on.

## Rhetorical Techniques

- **Cross-domain analogies.** The standout technique. Bridges disciplines freely — the "AI as unreliable narrator" post draws from literary criticism (Holden Caulfield, narrative theory) to frame a technology concept. This is signature.
- **Concrete examples before abstract points.** Leads with "I did this, here's what happened" before drawing the principle out.
- **Anecdotal evidence.** Uses personal classroom stories and experiments as proof points. "I asked ChatGPT about nitrogenases and cyanobacteria..." — draws on his own research background.
- **Clever one-liners.** "If you are an educator, you are probably already an expert at managing AI prompts." — Turns a complex idea into a compact, shareable observation.
- **Teaching through doing.** Doesn't just describe — shows readers how to replicate. Creates actionable strategies (e.g., asking ChatGPT to introduce deliberate errors for students to find).

## Vocabulary & Language

- **NZ English conventions.** Colour, behaviour, organise, analyse, programme.
- **Technical vocabulary used naturally.** Doesn't shy from specialist terms (nitrogenases, cyanobacteria) but doesn't gatekeep with jargon either.
- **Education terminology grounded in practice.** Uses terms like BYOD, LMS, e-learning but always in context of actual use, not buzzword-dropping.
- **Accessible without condescension.** Assumes the reader is intelligent but may not share his specific expertise.

## Paragraph & Structure

- **Short-to-medium paragraphs.** Rarely dense blocks of text. Digestible chunks.
- **Clear progression.** Sets up context, introduces the idea, demonstrates it, draws out the implication.
- **Section headings used for longer pieces.** Breaks content into navigable sections.

## Topics & Themes

- **AI in education** — consistently returns to practical classroom applications, not theory
- **Science of learning** — how people actually learn, evidence-based approaches
- **Gamified learning** — engagement through game-like structures
- **Ed-tech tools** — reviews and uses tools, always assessed through "does this actually help?"
- **STEM + creativity crossover** — unusual combination of science, drama, digital technology backgrounds

## What Makes It Distinctive

1. **The cross-disciplinary lens.** A science teacher who thinks in literary terms. Uses narrative frameworks to explain tech concepts. This bridging is rare and distinctive.
2. **Practitioner voice.** Nearly 30 years in classrooms. Writes from lived experience, not theory.
3. **Tinkerer mentality.** Tries things, breaks things, reports back. "This semester I'm going to try building my own AI-automated project management system (aka LMS)."
4. **No padding.** Says what needs saying and stops. Professional and respectful of the reader's time.
5. **Teaching instinct embedded in writing.** Even blog posts are structured to help the reader learn something, not just consume content.

## Gaps / Areas to Explore Further

- **The Ghost blog (pursuelearning.net) was not directly accessible** via automated tools — 403 blocked all fetches. A manual review of the full blog archive would significantly strengthen this profile.
- **Longer-form writing samples** (beyond the "Unreliable Narrator" post) would help pin down how style varies with post length and topic.
- **Newsletter-specific voice** may differ from blog posts — worth checking if the Ghost newsletter has a different register.
